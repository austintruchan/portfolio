                <p>MSU Telecasters was founded in 1954. It is a student run organization that is made up of seven different television shows ranging from comedy to drama, satirical journalism to journalism, and live-production to film style production. MSU Telecasters is the second largest student organization at Michigan State University. It is comprised of a plethora of students from around the universityâ€™s campus. Their goal is to provide an environment that allows for students to help other students grow professionally and socially. <span>In late 2014, The MSU Telecasters came to me looking for a new, revamped, and modern website, and was honored to be able to build them one.</span></p></div>

                <p>Using Bootstrap, I was able to quickly implement a new, fully functioning site within a week, that was clean, simple, beautiful, and most importantly responsive. The biggest achievement, was being able to use open source javascript and php to build a functioning Join Us Form, that increases the odds of newcomers joining the MSU Telecasters.</p></div>

                <p>The site works wonderfully on mobile devices, which according to analytics, is how most users have accessed the site.
