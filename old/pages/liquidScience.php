                <p><span>Liquid Science is an electronic/electro/house music artist who currently produces his own music and DJ's locally in the areas of East Lansing and Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.</span> He has asked me to design his album art for all of his EP's, which you can see below.</p></div>

            <div class="design-single content">
                <p>BLACK GOLD was designed with "black" and "gold" in mind. By combining a unique element representing "Black Gold", with a complex, science-fiction styled font, the album art creates a unique, simple and strong approach to the concept of what "Black Gold" might be. The sleek look fits well with Liquid Science's sci-fi/electronic music.</p></div>

            <div class="design-single content">
                <p>SkyDrive was designed literally. A spacecraft flying over a distant planet. But by adding the spacecraft's blue, crooked trail, an interesting element is created that lead's the eye across the piece, and supplements the purple planet with it's blue color. The Sci-fi theme that is created through the atmospheric planet, the futuristic text, and the spacecraft fits well with Liquid Science's electronic style.</p></div>

            <div class="design-single content">
                <p>Salamander Milk Soap offers another Sci-fi feel with an alien-ish aspect to it. Through the blurry/bright environment, the viewer is taken to a dreamscape in which an alien has just landed in front of them. The text was designed to be incorporated into the piece, and not just stand out.</p></div>

              <div class="design-single content">
                <p>This piece, titled "Solvean", a combination of Solitude and Heaven, focuses on the chill, electronic vibes that are present in this album. The three glowing elements of different galaxy together create something visually appealing. To contrast with the thick orbs, the extended limbs, or lines help create visual interest. </p></div>

              <div class="design-single content">
                <p>The spacious elements in this piece symbolize the sketchy, glitch music that Liquid Science features in this album. This piece is interesting through the use of saturation. By creating a very saturated element up front, and a less saturated element in back, depth is created in the composition. By keeping one of the "e's" in "Science" white, the user has a tendency top look back, and read "Liquid Science". </p></div></div>
