              <p>Funkatron is a conceptual "Super Hero" logo design. Funkatron is a dancing robot that comes from the year 2108, a time when there is a need for specialized robots robots programmed in the art of dance. Funkatron has traveled back in time to 2015 to simply be the best dancer in the world, as he feels meaningless in the future of advanced dancing robots. In 2015, he is a god-like dancer, and people from all over the world travel to see Funkatron perform the future of dance. <span>Below you can see the initial sketches mades toward the development of the Funkatron logo.</span></div>

              <p>After review and critique, I chose the best two logo concepts from the sketching process. I then brought them into Illustrator, and created two variations of each. You can see them below. The second logo from the right is what I decided to go with. The logo is representative of Funkatron through the "F", and also carries over the concept of music/dance through the repition of the F, abstractly representing sound waves.</p></div>

          <div class="design-single content">
              <p>After narrowing down a logo design, I knew I had to develop the type treatment from scratch in order to match the style of the "F" within the logo design. You can see the font design below.</p></div>

              <a href="#5"><img src="../style/img/Funkatron/Funkatron-Type.png"/></a></div>

          <div class="design-single content">
              <p>Now that I had my logo and type treatment designs, it was time for some color. I pulled inspiration from many different 70's and 80's color schemes to go along with the funk and dance concepts. You can see my color palette inspirations below.</p>

          <div class="design-single content">
              <p>I then began applying the different color schemes to the logo and type treatment designs, as seen below. However, I was unable to reach a result that I truly enjoyed. They all felt outdated, and none of them felt modern enough. None of them succesfully captured the time period of the 70's and 80's in a futuristic fashion.</p>

          <div class="design-single content">
              <p>I then continued searching for the perfect color scheme, that was modern and futuristic, yet still "funky." The color scheme I ended up with, uses multiple shades of turquoises and teals, with an accent yellow that really makes the whole design pop, giving it that futuristic edge I had been looking for. I then refined the logo and type treatment a bit until I was truly happy with the design as a whole.</p></div>
