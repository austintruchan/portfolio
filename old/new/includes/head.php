        <meta name="description" content="Iâ€™m Austin Truchan, a Digital Designer based in East Lansing, Michigan. I specialize in UI/UX, Interaction & Web Design, but dabble in everything from logos, to icons and product illustrations. I enjoy creating elegant, delightful works that put usability and accessiblity first. I am also pretty obsessed with dystopic scifi genres, and the clash of geometric and organic forms.">
