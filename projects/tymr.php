					<h2>Time Tracking Mac & iOS App Concept</h2></div></div>
			
			<div class="project-content">
  			
  			<p>Tymr is a conceptual Mac, iPhone and iPad application for personal and team based time tracking. I prefer using native applications over web based, and I wish a well designed, cross-device, personal time tracking app like this existed. </p>
								
				<a href="#img4"><img class="no-shadow" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/4.jpg"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img4"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/4.jpg"></a>
				
					<p>Tymr is my own exploration of what a cross-device personal time tracking app could be, and I hope you like it! Any Mac or iOS developers out there that want to help me build it? ðŸ˜† </p>

				<a href="#img1"><img class="rounded" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/1.jpg"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img1"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/1.jpg"></a>
				
				<p>The Dashboard (above) acts as the home page to Tymr, quickly highlighting key information that is important to the user.  The Dashboard is built up of customizable blocks, that can be dragged and reordered, or removed from the dashboard. This allows the user to put information that is most important to them front and center. Examples of blocks included: Time tracked today and this week, amount earned today and this week, Time spent on tasks, time spent on projects, a list of what was worked on today, and the users planned work schedule. </p>
				
				<p>At the top of every page in Tymr, exists the fixed and consistent time entry bar. This gives the user quick access to start a timer, to add a task and project, or to see the how much is on their active timer. There is also a plus button next to the start timer button, that allows the user to enter a manual time, in the case they forgot to previously. </p>
						
				<a href="#img2"><img class="rounded" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/2.jpg"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img2"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/2.jpg"></a>
				
				<p>The Records page is the place to go see all of your tracked time. The user can view their time records in a weekly, monthly, or yearly format, and can view them in a list or calendar view. The user is also given filtering options to select the exact week if viewing records weekly (defaulted to the current week), and options to filter the records by a certain task or project. The user can then download their records as a formatted pdf, csv or xml file.</p>
				
				<p>Here the user also has the option of editing records. They can change the start and end dates and times, as well as the task and project. They are also given the option to duplicate or delete the record entirely. </p>
				
				<a href="#img3"><img class="rounded" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/3.jpg"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img3"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/3.jpg"></a>
				
				<p>The Activity page allows the user to see a graphical view of their work progress over time. Here we can see a graph representing the number of hours worked for the user the past week day by day. Beneath the graph lists the projects that were worked on this week, or the selected time interval, with the option to hide or reveal them from the graph.</p>
				
				<p>The same as the Records page, the user has the option to view this data weekly, monthly or yearly, and they are also given the option to select the exact time frame, or filter by tasks and projects.</p>
				
				<p>This page also provides an example of an active timer, with the task and project inputs filled out. And as a side, I thought it would be really great if the Tymr logo in the sidebar animated like clock hands when the timer is active. </p>
				
				<a href="#img6"><img class="no-shadow" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/6.png"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img6"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/6.png"></a>
				
				<p>Tymr also conceptually has native iOS applications for iPhone and iPad as well for a seamless cross device experience. Nice! The iPhone app is structured with two fixed buttons at the bottom of each page, one to access the sidebar menu (can also be accessed by swiping right anywhere on the screen), and the start timer button. </p>
				
				<a href="#img7"><img class="no-shadow" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/7.png"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img7"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/7.png"></a>
				
				<p>Hitting the start timer button, well, starts the timer, and brings up a modal to fill out the task and project, add a manual time, or adjust the current time duration. As the timer is active, the duration is displayed next to the stop timer button.</p>
				
				<a href="#img8"><img class="no-shadow" src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/8.png"/></a>
				<a onclick="goBack()" class="lightbox" id="img8"><img src="../style/imgs/projects/tymr/8.png"></a>
				
				<p>And of course the full cross-device experience isnâ€™t complete without a native iPad app. The iPad version isnâ€™t too different from the Mac version, but is a great addition for those that prefer working on their iPads.</p>
						
				<p>Check it out, give it a like, and provide some feedback on <a href="https://dribbble.com/austintruchan" target="_blank" class="link-inline">Dribbble!</a></p>
