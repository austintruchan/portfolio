					<h2>hey there.</h2>
				
			<p class="about">I'm Austin. Iâ€™m a Digital Designer currently residing in East Lansing, Michigan. I specialize in UI/UX, Interaction & Web Design, but dabble in everything from frontend development, to logo/icon design, to experimental graphic design. I am also rather obsessed with dystopic scifi genres, and the clash of geometric and organic forms. I currently work for a digital humanities web design studio, Matrix, as their Head of Design, and also work remotely as the Design Lead for DishRoots, a startup focused on designing an authentic dish discovery platform.</p>

			<h2>my story.</h2>
			<p class="about">It all started in middle school when my dad handed me his bootlegged copy of photoshop. I instantly fell in love with the program and the ability to alter imagery, and arrange digital shapes  and typography to make my own unique compositions. I soon found myself designing myspace avatars, facebook cover photos and album artwork for my all of my friends, and all of their many bands. I was in love with the craft of digital design. 
<br><br>
I went to Michigan State University and studied Interactive Web Design with a specialization in Design. Here I become apart of many groups that focused on digital media. I redesigned and developed the website for two different film clubs, I worked with a street team that helped out non-profits by rebranding their identities for the greater good, and worked as the lead designer for the Michigan State Hackathon, Spartahack. I also worked for Matrix, a digital humanities web design studio as a student designer and developer. After graduation, they just had to hire me as a full time employee, where I now work as their Head of Design and Frontend Development. 
<br><br>
Outside of Matrix, I continue to design, design & do some more design. I also work remotely for a startup in California, DishRoots, where I work on iOS and Web design. I also find time to work on several of my own side projects, and daily exercises that keep me experimenting and tinkering within the realms of digital design.</p>

			<h2>likes.</h2>
			<p class="about">When i'm not designing, i'm probably walking and hiking all of the local nature trails, making myself a hot pour-over coffee, or reading and learning about something new. I've recently fallen in love with zen-ing out, learning how to meditate and do yoga, and becoming a minimalist. Oh! and I finally got a DSLR, so it's been fun experimenting and learning how that  thing works. They say i'm soon to be the next, big instagram star.</p>
